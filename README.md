# Click-Through Rate (CTR) Forecasting 📊📅

## Introduction
In digital advertising, measuring the effectiveness of an ad campaign is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies. One of the key performance indicators (KPIs) used in online advertising is the **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**, which represents the ratio of users who click on an advertisement to the number of times it is displayed (impressions).

Predicting future CTR trends can help advertisers make data-driven decisions, allocate budgets effectively, and improve ad performance. This project focuses on building a **time series forecasting model** to predict future CTR values based on historical advertisement performance data. 🚀

## Aim 🎯
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast future CTR values by analyzing past click and impression data. The model will help in understanding trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in ad performance, allowing advertisers to optimize their strategies and improve return on investment (ROI). 💰📈

## Dataset Overview 📑
The dataset consists of daily records of ad performance, including the number of clicks, impressions, and their respective timestamps. The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Date**: The date on which the data was recorded (YYYY-MM-DD format). This serves as the time index for forecasting.
- **Clicks**: The number of times users clicked on the ad on a given day.
- **Impressions**: The number of times the ad was displayed to users on a given day.

## Target Variable 🎯
The **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** is computed as:

\[
\text{CTR} = \frac{\text{Clicks}}{\text{Impressions}} \times 100
\]

This will be the primary metric we aim to forecast.

By analyzing this dataset, we can identify trends, seasonality, and other factors affecting CTR and develop a suitable forecasting model. 📈

## Approach 🛠️
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, check for outliers, and preprocess data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract additional features such as week of the year, month, or holiday periods.
- **Model Selection**: Use time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning models like RandomForestRegressor.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

## Conclusion 📍
In this study, we analyzed historical **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** data and built a forecasting model to predict future trends. The CTR has shown a gradual decline over the past year with occasional fluctuations. Using our predictive model, we forecasted CTR values for the next 100 days.

The forecasted results indicate a slight downward trend, suggesting that CTR may continue to decline in the upcoming months. However, there are small fluctuations in the predicted values, indicating potential short-term variations.

The accuracy and reliability of these predictions depend on various factors, including external influences on ad performance, seasonality, and possible market changes. Further improvements can be achieved by incorporating additional features, fine-tuning the model, or experimenting with different forecasting techniques. 🔧
